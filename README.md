# Hi there, I'm Mitra Abhi Sura!

I am a cybersecurity enthusiast currently pursuing a specialization in Cybersecurity and Privacy at my university. My passion for cybersecurity has driven me to pursue a career in the field, and I am currently learning about pentesting and JavaScript to enhance my skills.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I am developing an Android pet care app using Android Studio. This project is a personal initiative to combine my interest in technology and love for pets. I hope this app will help pet owners keep track of their pet's health and wellbeing.

## What I'm Learning

In addition to my ongoing work on the pet care app, I am also studying for the CEH and CISSP exams. These certifications are important to me as they will provide me with a deeper understanding of the cybersecurity field and validate my knowledge and skills.

## Fun Fact About Me

In my free time, I enjoy expressing my creativity through sketching, and I also love to unwind with a good book from time to time.

## Get in Touch

I am always interested in connecting with like-minded individuals in the cybersecurity community. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me through my email (`sura.mitraa@gmail.com`)
